Most of the observations are close to the mean. Very few observations are close to the margins (0 and 15).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap ~ Gender, data = df)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shape of the distribution is similar for males and females. The median, first quartile, third quartile lung capacity values all seem to be somewhat higher for males.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarize(LungCap = mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke LungCap\n  <chr>   <dbl>\n1 no       7.77\n2 yes      8.65\n\n\nThe lung capacity for smokers seems to be higher than non-smokers. It goes against the common idea that smoking would hurt lung capacity.\n\n\n\n\nLess than or equal to 13\n\n\n\nCode\ndf %>%\n  filter(Age <= 13) %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarize(LungCap = mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke LungCap\n  <chr>   <dbl>\n1 no       6.36\n2 yes      7.20\n\n\n\n14 to 15\n\n\n\nCode\ndf %>%\n  filter(Age == 14 | Age == 15) %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarize(LungCap = mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke LungCap\n  <chr>   <dbl>\n1 no       9.14\n2 yes      8.39\n\n\n\n16 to 17\n\n\n\nCode\ndf %>%\n  filter(Age == 16 | Age == 17) %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarize(LungCap = mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke LungCap\n  <chr>   <dbl>\n1 no      10.5 \n2 yes      9.38\n\n\n\nGreater than or equal to 18\n\n\n\nCode\ndf %>%\n  filter(Age >= 18) %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarize(LungCap = mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke LungCap\n  <chr>   <dbl>\n1 no       11.1\n2 yes      10.5\n\n\n\n\n\nFor three out of the four groups, lung capacity if smaller for smokers. This makes another explanation plausible. Smoking is inversely related to lung capacity, but older people both smoke more and have more lung capacity. Thus, considering the relationship between smoking and lung capacity without looking at age makes the relationship look the opposite of what it is.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncov(df$LungCap, df$Age)\n\n\n[1] 8.738289\n\n\nCode\ncor(df$LungCap, df$Age)\n\n\n[1] 0.8196749\n\n\nBoth the correlation and the covariance are positive (when one of them is the other has to). Positive values suggest that people who are older tend to have higher lung capacity, confirming what we found. Since correlation is standardized (needs to be between -1 and 1), its absolute value tells us about the strength of the relationship. 0.82 suggests a pretty strong relationship."

You're passing a function as global data.\n  Have you misspelled the `data` argument in `ggplot()`\n\n\nThe distribution of male lung capacity is larger and longer than females’.\n#c. Compare the mean lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers.

In this sample, smokers have a higher mean lung capacity than non-smokers. Let’s check how big each subsample is.\n\n\nCode\nlength(which(df$Smoke == 'yes'))\n\n\nError in df$Smoke: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable\n\n\nCode\nlength(which(df$Smoke == 'no'))\n\n\nError in df$Smoke: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable\n\n\nAs suspected, there are far more, almost 10 times as many, non-smokers. If we could gather data from all the smokers, perhaps our means would look a lot different. Maybe our sample was taken from young people whose lungs have not been long affected by the smoking.\n\n\nCode\ndf %>%\n  filter(Smoke == 'yes') %>%\n  pull(Age) %>%\n  median() \n\n\nError in UseMethod(\"filter\"): no applicable method for 'filter' applied to an object of class \"function\"\n\n\nAgain, as suspected, our sample of smokers is a young age. Therefore, the lack of difference in lung capacity between smokers and non-smokers is not too surprising.\n#d. Examine the relationship between Smoking and Lung Capacity within age groups: “less than or equal to 13”, “14 to 15”, “16 to 17”, and “greater than or equal to 18”.\n\n\nCode\n#Create age groups\ndf <- df %>% \n  mutate(agegroup = case_when(\n    Age <= 13  ~ \"less than or equal to 13\",\n    Age >= 14 & Age <= 15 ~ \"14 to 15\",\n    Age >= 16 & Age <= 17 ~ \"16 TO 17\",\n    Age >= 18 ~ \"greater than or equal to 18\"))\n\n\nError in UseMethod(\"mutate\"): no applicable method for 'mutate' applied to an object of class \"function\"\n\n\nCode\ntable(df$agegroup)\n\n\nError in df$agegroup: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable\n\n\nCode\ndf %>%\n  filter(Smoke == 'yes') %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=LungCap)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth=1,col='black',fill='gray')+\n  facet_wrap(~agegroup)\n\n\nError in UseMethod(\"filter\"): no applicable method for 'filter' applied to an object of class \"function\"\n\n\nThese histograms suggest that participants 13 or younger have smaller lung capacity. The Lung capacity seems to generally increase with age as children grow.\n#e. Compare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group. Is your answer different from the one in part c. What could possibly be going on here?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = LungCap, \n           fill = agegroup)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.4)+\n  facet_wrap(~Smoke)\n\n\nError in `ggplot()`:\n!   You're passing a function as global data.\n  Have you misspelled the `data` argument in `ggplot()`\n\n\nThis visualization starts to explain furthermore why there is an unexpected result for lung capacity in smokers vs. non-smokers. As we have deducted, lung capacity generally improves with age (in growing years). However, teenagers approaching adulthood are also a group more likely to have access or influence to smoking cigarettes. It is likely that our smokers account for some of the older participants, who happen to be closer to normal smoking age.\n#f. Calculate the correlation and covariance between Lung Capacity and Age. (use the cov() and cor() functions in R).

It further categorizes the subjects by height, sex, smoking habits, and whether they were birthed using the Caesarean section technique.\nIn the following sections, we’ll use select(), group_by(), filter(), and summarize() to further explore the data and find important relations between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLungCap looks to be approximately normally distributed (unimodal, symmetric) with most observations centered around the mean (7.86).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhist_gender <- ggplot(og_lungcap, aes(x=LungCap, y=..density.., fill=Gender)) +\n  geom_histogram(alpha=.5, position=\"identity\", bins=20)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(LungCap)))\nhist_gender\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage ggplot2 functions ggplot() and geom_histogram() are used to display the LungCap distribution filled by the Gender variable. Both density plots center on the mean, indicating both male and female lung capacity observations are highly concentrated around the mean. The male distribution is shifted slightly to the right of the female distribution, meaning male observations had a higher upper range value than female observations. Males had more observations concentrated to the right of the mean, and the female distribution reciprocated this effect to the left of the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsmokers <- group_by(og_lungcap, Smoke)\nsmokers %>%\n  summarize(mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke `mean(LungCap)`\n  <chr>           <dbl>\n1 no               7.77\n2 yes              8.65\n\n\nAfter creating a new dataset smokers by using group_by() on our original data, smokers is piped into a summarize() call. The results surprisingly show that the smoking group had a higher mean lung capacity than the nonsmoking group. This is likely due to a mean age difference within the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Creating Age Groups Using Case When\n\nsmokers_age <- smokers %>%\n  mutate(AgeGroup = case_when(Age >= 18 ~ \"18+\", \n            Age == 16 | Age == 17 ~ \"16-17\",\n            Age == 14 | Age == 15 ~ \"14-15\",\n            Age <= 13~ \"Under 13\"))\n\n# Mean LungCap by Age and Smoke\n# Must regroup by Smoke again\nsmokers_age %>%\n  group_by(AgeGroup, Smoke) %>%\n    summarize(mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n# Groups:   AgeGroup [4]\n  AgeGroup Smoke `mean(LungCap)`\n  <chr>    <chr>           <dbl>\n1 14-15    no               9.14\n2 14-15    yes              8.39\n3 16-17    no              10.5 \n4 16-17    yes              9.38\n5 18+      no              11.1 \n6 18+      yes             10.5 \n7 Under 13 no               6.36\n8 Under 13 yes              7.20\n\n\nAfter using mutate() to add a column AgeGroup to a copy of smokers, group_by() groups the new dataset by AgeGroup and Smoke before piping it into a summarize() command to find the grouped means of LungCap by AgeGroup and Smoke.\nThe results show that for children above the age of 13, smokers had a lower mean lung capacity than non-smokers. However, for the 13 and under group, we again see results that imply smokers have greater lung capacity than nonsmokers. Let’s investigate further into the relationship between age and lung capacity to explain this quizzical result.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncov(og_lungcap$Age, og_lungcap$LungCap)\n\n\n[1] 8.738289\n\n\nCode\ncor(og_lungcap$Age, og_lungcap$LungCap)\n\n\n[1] 0.8196749\n\n\nCode\n#GGPlot of Age vs Lung\nggplot(og_lungcap, aes(x=Age, y=LungCap)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nAge and LungCap have a high covariance which leads to a high correlation (p=0.82). This strong positive value (-1<p<1) indicates these variables “vary greatly” together: when Age is high in the data, so is LungCap. We cannot say that an increase in Age causes an increase Lung capacity without first showing this through regression; however, our results show the variables are highly correlated.\nWe can use knowledge of the human body to infer that as our body ages, our lungs mature. The ages of smokers of the Under 13 group are likely highly left skewed, as I don’t expect many children under 10 to be smoking.

This is true in all categories except for Under 13, which is likely because smokers in that category are going to be older than nonsmokers in that category (i.e. it is more likely that a 12 year old smokes than a 6 year old, and a 12 year old has a larger lung capacity than a 6 year old regardless of smoking status)\nThis explains the first calculation of mean by smoking status (before finding the mean by age categories). Smokers are generally going to be older than non-smokers for this sample (the oldest participant in the sample is 19- see code below), which explains why the mean for smokers versus non-smokers (not separated by age categories) makes it look like smokers have a higher average lung capacity.\n\n\nCode\n#checking how old participants in the sample are\nlungcap %>% \n  summarize(range(Age))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 1\n  `range(Age)`\n         <dbl>\n1            3\n2           19\n\n\n\n\n1f.\nCalculating the correlation and covariance between Lung Capacity and Age:\n\n\nCode\n#Creating vectors of Age and Lung Capacity from df (lungcap) to apply cov() and cor() functions to\nx<-c(lungcap$Age)\ny<-c(lungcap$LungCap)\n\n\n#Calculating covariance\ncov(x, y)\n\n\n[1] 8.738289\n\n\nCode\n#calculating correlation\ncor(x, y)\n\n\n[1] 0.8196749\n\n\nThe covariance, 8.738 is fairly high and positive, meaning as age increases, so does lung capacity (i.e. age and lung capacity co-vary).

    "text": "Research Question\nThe research question I want to explore is whether child poverty has increased in schools that are predominantly made up of non-white students from the 2014-2015 school year to the 2020-2021 school year. I think this is extremely important to look at because of the pandemic’s impact on not only child learning but also families’ economic resources. According to the Columbia University Center on Poverty and Social Policy, “nearly a quarter of children ages 0-3 live in poverty and nearly half of the city’s young children live in lower-opportunity neighborhoods where the poverty rate is at least 20 percent” (“Poverty”). Unfortunately, research shows that poverty is disproportionately felt according to one’s race or ethnicity. In New York State, as of 2021, child poverty among children of color is almost 30%, with Black or African American children more than twice as likely to live in poverty than White, Non-Hispanic children (“New York State”, 2021). With this disproportionate level of economic need in children of color, it seems important to investigate if the poverty level within New York City schools that are predominately non-White has increased significantly compared to schools that are predominantly White. When searching the UMass Libraries databases and other sources, it was hard to find studies that used this data in this way. It is important to understand if there is increasing poverty levels within an already vulnerable group."

    "text": "Hypothesis\nI hypothesize that the poverty rate in NYC schools that are predominantly children of color will have increased more between the 2014-2015 and the 2020-2021 school years than the poverty rate in schools that are predominantly White. Since I have not found many previous studies on this, it is hard to know if this hypothesis was tested before. However, this data is fairly recent and also relates to the pandemic’s effects on economics, so I think it is still a significant contribution to test this hypothesis."

    "text": "Descriptive Statistics\nA description and summary of your data. How was your data collected by its original collectors? What are the important variables of interest for your research question? Use functions like glimpse() and summary() to present your data.\nThe data was collected by New York City and put on its Open Data source. The data covers NYC schools in the academic years 2014-2015 to 2020-2021. The important variables of interest included in the data are:\n\nAcademic year\nNumber and percentage of Asisan, Black, Hispanic, and White students\nNumber and percentage of students in poverty\nEconomic need index, which is the average of students’ “Economic Need Values”\n\nThe Economic Need Index (ENI) estimates the percentage of students facing economic hardship\n\n\nThe other variables included are: DBN (district, borough, school number), school name, total enrollment, enrollment numbers for K-12, number and percentage of female and male students, number and percentage of students with disabilities, and number and percentage of English-Language Learner (ELL) students.\n\n\nCode\nglimpse(school_data)\n\n\nError in glimpse(school_data): object 'school_data' not found\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsummary(school_data)\n\n\nError in summary(school_data): object 'school_data' not found\n\n\nCode\n# Note: the summary data for the enrollment numbers split by grade is somewhat off (especially minimums) because there is no variable listed for type of school (i.e., middle versus high school). So, for example, an elementary school would have an enrollment total of 0 for grade 12, which would show up as the minimum.\n\n\nAs we can see from this summary, the median percent of poverty in NYC schools (81.4%) is higher than the mean percent (75.89%), indicating that there may be low outliers with very low percentages of poverty. The same holds true for the Economic Need Index, with the mean (0.691) lower than the median (0.743). It is troubling, however, that both the mean and median percentages of poverty in NYC schools overall is more than three-fourths of the population."

As of this point in my calculations, the only relationship seems to be between age and lung capacity rather than smoking and lung capacity; this is due to the facts that: 1) not that many people ages 0-17 smoke, and 2) the sample sizes for the 14-17 age group is 100 compared to the 428 responses in the \"13 and under\" group.\n\n\nLC_Age18p <- LungCap %>%\n  select(LungCap, Age, Smoke) %>%\n  filter(Age >= 18)\nrange(LC_Age18p$LungCap)\n\n[1]  7.750 14.675\n\n#The minimum and maximum range values for the 18+ age group are 7.750 and 14.675.

The mean lung capacity for this group is the highest of all of them at 10.965, but this still doesn't seem to show a relationship between smoking and lung capacity.

    "text": "First, let’s read in the data from the Excel file:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.3.6      ✔ purrr   0.3.5 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndf <- read_excel(\"_data/LungCapData.xls\")\n\n\nThe distribution of LungCap looks as follows:\n\n\nCode\nhist(df$LungCap)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram suggests that the distribution is close to a normal distribution. Most of the observations are close to the mean. Very few observations are close to the margins (0 and 15).\n\n\n\nNext, let’s compare the probability distribution of the LungCap with respect to Males and Females, using a boxplot.\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap ~ Gender, df)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum and mean are very similar to each other, with the minimum around 1 and the mean around 8. The maximum does differ though by gender, at 13 to 14/15 respectively.\n\n\n\nFor the third question, we’re going to compare the mean lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers. To compare the mean, we’ll again use the box-plot.\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap ~ Smoke, df)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the mean is very similar, hovering between 8 and 9, the range is what is substantial. A smoker’s lung capacity has a much smaller range, 4 - 13, compared to non-smokers, at 1 - 15. This makes sense, as a smoker’s lungs would start to have less capacity through consistent substance abuse.\n\n\n\nFor question four, we need to create a new variable, Age Group, followed by comparing the relationship between Smoking and Lung Capacity, broken down by Age Group. First, we’ll create the new column, referencing the Age column to determine groups.\n\n\nCode\ndf_new <- df %>%\n  mutate(\n    Age_Group = dplyr::case_when(\n      Age <= 13 ~ \"Less than or equal to 13\",\n      Age == 14 | Age == 15 ~ \"14 or 15\",\n      Age == 16 | Age == 17 ~ \"16 or 17\",\n      Age >= 18 ~ \"Greater than or equal to 18\"\n    ),\n    Age_Group = factor(\n      Age_Group,\n      level = c(\"Less than or equal to 13\", \"14 or 15\", \"16 or 17\", \"Greater than or equal to 18\")\n    )\n  )\nhead(df_new)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  LungCap   Age Height Smoke Gender Caesarean Age_Group                  \n    <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <chr> <chr>  <chr>     <fct>                      \n1    6.48     6   62.1 no    male   no        Less than or equal to 13   \n2   10.1     18   74.7 yes   female no        Greater than or equal to 18\n3    9.55    16   69.7 no    female yes       16 or 17                   \n4   11.1     14   71   no    male   no        14 or 15                   \n5    4.8      5   56.9 no    male   no        Less than or equal to 13   \n6    6.22    11   58.7 no    female no        Less than or equal to 13   \n\n\nGood. Now we can place a histogram to better understand the relationship between LungCap and Smoking status. To view it by age group, we’ll add a facet wrap to the visualization.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_new, aes(LungCap, color=Smoke)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~Age_Group)\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose that are smokers have a smaller sample size than non-smokers. Looking purely at the distribution of each, we can see that three of the four age groups follow a normal distribution, save the 14 or 15 group that has a somewhat “two hump” distribution.\nEven so, smoking status does seem to mirror the non-smoker distribution, when it comes to the overall sample count and LungCap.\n\n\n\nFor the fifth question, we’ll compare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group. We’ll use a box-plot and facet wrap this visualization again by Age Group.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_new, aes(LungCap, Smoke)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~Age_Group)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can readily see that smokers, irrespective of age, have a substantially smaller lung capacity range compared to non-smokers. While the mean might be similar, sometimes even smaller for “13 years old or less”, the length of each capacity varies for non-smokers where it doesn’t for smokers.\n\n\n\nFor the sixth question, we shall calculate the covariance and correlation between LungCap and Age.\n\n\nCode\ncov(df$LungCap, df$Age)\n\n\n[1] 8.738289\n\n\nCode\ncor(df$LungCap, df$Age)\n\n\n[1] 0.8196749\n\n\nCovariance is the relationship between a pair of random variables where change in one variable causes change in another variable. With a covariance of 8.73, that means that there is a positive relationship between the two variables and that, by every 1 point change of Age, that can result in an average of 8.73 point change in LungCap.\nCorrelations show whether and how strongly pairs or variables are related to one another. Correlation can range from 0.0 to 1.0. With a result of 0.81, that means there is a high correlation between LungCap and Age."

Based on what we now know about how smoking affects the lungs, these results don’t seem to make sense. However, there is the possibility that smokers may be more used to deep inhales/exhales and therefore could have better lung capacity until the substance has more of an effect on their lungs. There may also be external factors that led to these results that aren’t clear from the data right now.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nLungCapData <- within(LungCapData, {\n  Age.group <- NA\n  Age.group[Age <= 13] <- \"13 and Under\"\n  Age.group[Age >= 14 & Age <= 15] <- \"14-15\"\n  Age.group[Age >= 16 & Age <= 17] <- \"16-17\"\n  Age.group[Age >= 18] <- \"18 and Over\"\n} )\n\n\nError in within(LungCapData, {: object 'LungCapData' not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Boxplots\n\nsmoking_age <- filter(LungCapData, Smoke == \"yes\")\n\n\nError in filter(LungCapData, Smoke == \"yes\"): object 'LungCapData' not found\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap ~ Age.group, data = smoking_age,\n        main = \"Lung Capacity of Smokers by Age Group\",\n        xlab = \"Age Group\", ylab = \"Lung Capacity\")\n\n\nError in eval(m$data, parent.frame()): object 'smoking_age' not found\n\n\nFrom the boxplot above, we can see that smokers’ lung capacities reach about a maximum of 12 as age increases, but there is not very much improvement in the maximums. The medians move a bit more as age increases, but still not very dramatically after ages 14 and 15. Smokers that are 18 and over have higher lung capacities overall, but this may just be because of natural aging processes and development.\n\n\nCode\n# Means\n\nsmoking_age %>%\n  group_by(Age.group) %>%\n  summarise_at(vars(LungCap), list(name = mean))\n\n\nError in group_by(., Age.group): object 'smoking_age' not found\n\n\nWe see the same trend in means as in the medians: mean lung capacity to increases as the age increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Boxplot\n\nnonsmoking_age <- filter(LungCapData, Smoke == \"no\")\n\n\nError in filter(LungCapData, Smoke == \"no\"): object 'LungCapData' not found\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap ~ Age.group, data = nonsmoking_age,\n        main = \"Lung Capacity of Non-Smokers by Age Group\",\n        xlab = \"Age Group\", ylab = \"Lung Capacity\")\n\n\nError in eval(m$data, parent.frame()): object 'nonsmoking_age' not found\n\n\nIn non-smokers, we see the same trend of increasing lung capacities as age increases, but the median lung capacities in the two older age groups in the non-smoking group are higher than those in the smoking group. There are also more outliers for non-smokers, especially in the 14-15 category.\n\n\nCode\n# Means\n\nnonsmoking_age %>%\n  group_by(Age.group) %>%\n  summarise_at(vars(LungCap), list(name = mean))\n\n\nError in group_by(., Age.group): object 'nonsmoking_age' not found\n\n\nThe means of the non-smoking group by age follow the same trend as the medians, as well as in the smoking group.

However, from the boxplot of Smokers by Age Group, we can see that there is a very low outlier in this age group, which might be affecting the mean for this group as well as overall smokers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nLungCapData %>%\n  filter(Age.group == \"14-15\") %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarise_at(vars(LungCap), list(name = mean))\n\n\nError in filter(., Age.group == \"14-15\"): object 'LungCapData' not found\n\n\nIn this age group, the mean lung capacity for non-smokers is higher than the mean lung capacity for smokers–unlike the younger group.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nLungCapData %>%\n  filter(Age.group == \"16-17\") %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarise_at(vars(LungCap), list(name = mean))\n\n\nError in filter(., Age.group == \"16-17\"): object 'LungCapData' not found\n\n\nThe same trend continues in this age group, with the mean lung capacity in non-smokers ages 16 and 17 higher than the mean lung capacity of smokers in this group. Yet as the ages increase, the mean lung capacities for non-smokers and smokers increase about the same amount (by 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nLungCapData %>%\n  filter(Age.group == \"18 and Over\") %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarise_at(vars(LungCap), list(name = mean))\n\n\nError in filter(., Age.group == \"18 and Over\"): object 'LungCapData' not found\n\n\nIn this oldest age group, the same trend continues: the mean lung capacity for non-smokers is higher than that of smokers. This pattern in the groups 18+, 16-17, and 14-15 are not found in the overall means for smokers and nonsmokers, suggesting that the outlier in the 13 and Under group might have brought down the overall mean for smokers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Correlation\n\ncor(LungCapData$Age, LungCapData$LungCap, use = \"everything\")\n\n\nError in is.data.frame(y): object 'LungCapData' not found\n\n\nThe correlation between lung capacity and age is positive and strong. As age increases, lung capacity also increases. The value of 0.8 is close to 1, meaning there is a somewhat strong relationship between the two variables.\n\n\nCode\n# Covariance\n\ncov(LungCapData$Age, LungCapData$LungCap, use = \"everything\")\n\n\nError in is.data.frame(y): object 'LungCapData' not found\n\n\nThe covariance is positive, meaning that there is a positive relationship between the varaibles, which is also clear from the correlation (since the correlation coefficient is a function of the covariance). Age and lung capacity have an overall positive relationship: as age increases, so does lung capacity."

Interestingly, lung capacity is worse for smokers than it is for non-smokers in every age group except for “13 and under”. This is surprising on the surface, given that, when the data are ungrouped, smokers have a higher lung capacity than non-smokers (see part c). However, this begins to make more sense when we see how much better the “13 and under” group is represented compared to the others in this dataset:\n\n\nCode\nlungcap_age %>% \n  group_by(age_group) %>% \n  count()\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n# Groups:   age_group [4]\n  age_group        n\n  <chr>        <int>\n1 13 and under   428\n2 14 to 15       120\n3 16 to 17        97\n4 18 and older    80\n\n\nThis high number of observations compared to other age groups likely plays a significant role in skewing the mean of the entire dataset."
