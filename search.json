This is true in all categories except for Under 13, which is likely because smokers in that category are going to be older than nonsmokers in that category (i.e. it is more likely that a 12 year old smokes than a 6 year old, and a 12 year old has a larger lung capacity than a 6 year old regardless of smoking status)\nThis explains the first calculation of mean by smoking status (before finding the mean by age categories). Smokers are generally going to be older than non-smokers for this sample (the oldest participant in the sample is 19- see code below), which explains why the mean for smokers versus non-smokers (not separated by age categories) makes it look like smokers have a higher average lung capacity.\n\n\nCode\n#checking how old participants in the sample are\nlungcap %>% \n  summarize(range(Age))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 1\n  `range(Age)`\n         <dbl>\n1            3\n2           19\n\n\n\n\n1f.\nCalculating the correlation and covariance between Lung Capacity and Age:\n\n\nCode\n#Creating vectors of Age and Lung Capacity from df (lungcap) to apply cov() and cor() functions to\nx<-c(lungcap$Age)\ny<-c(lungcap$LungCap)\n\n\n#Calculating covariance\ncov(x, y)\n\n\n[1] 8.738289\n\n\nCode\n#calculating correlation\ncor(x, y)\n\n\n[1] 0.8196749\n\n\nThe covariance, 8.738 is fairly high and positive, meaning as age increases, so does lung capacity (i.e. age and lung capacity co-vary).
