    "text": "1.) Using LungCapData, answer descriptive questions about the data and its distributions.\n2.) Use the given distribution to answer questions about the probability of discrete events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#| include: false\n#| label: Loading in LungCap\n\n og_lungcap <- readxl::read_xls(\"_data/LungCapData.xls\")\n\n# Quick look at dataset\n# glimpse(og_lungcap)\n\n# Variables - 3<dbl> ratio 3<char> (can coerce to logical if needed), \n\n# length(which(is.na(og_lungcap)))\n\n# No missing values to consider\n\n# Descriptive\n# summarytools::dfSummary(og_lungcap)\n\n\nLungCapData: Describes the lung capacity of a population of 725 children aged 3 - 19. It further categorizes the subjects by height, sex, smoking habits, and whether they were birthed using the Caesarean section technique.\nIn the following sections, we’ll use select(), group_by(), filter(), and summarize() to further explore the data and find important relations between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLungCap looks to be approximately normally distributed (unimodal, symmetric) with most observations centered around the mean (7.86).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhist_gender <- ggplot(og_lungcap, aes(x=LungCap, y=..density.., fill=Gender)) +\n  geom_histogram(alpha=.5, position=\"identity\", bins=20)+\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(LungCap)))\nhist_gender\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage ggplot2 functions ggplot() and geom_histogram() are used to display the LungCap distribution filled by the Gender variable. Both density plots center on the mean, indicating both male and female lung capacity observations are highly concentrated around the mean. The male distribution is shifted slightly to the right of the female distribution, meaning male observations had a higher upper range value than female observations. Males had more observations concentrated to the right of the mean, and the female distribution reciprocated this effect to the left of the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsmokers <- group_by(og_lungcap, Smoke)\nsmokers %>%\n  summarize(mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke `mean(LungCap)`\n  <chr>           <dbl>\n1 no               7.77\n2 yes              8.65\n\n\nAfter creating a new dataset smokers by using group_by() on our original data, smokers is piped into a summarize() call. The results surprisingly show that the smoking group had a higher mean lung capacity than the nonsmoking group. This is likely due to a mean age difference within the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Creating Age Groups Using Case When\n\nsmokers_age <- smokers %>%\n  mutate(AgeGroup = case_when(Age >= 18 ~ \"18+\", \n            Age == 16 | Age == 17 ~ \"16-17\",\n            Age == 14 | Age == 15 ~ \"14-15\",\n            Age <= 13~ \"Under 13\"))\n\n# Mean LungCap by Age and Smoke\n# Must regroup by Smoke again\nsmokers_age %>%\n  group_by(AgeGroup, Smoke) %>%\n    summarize(mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n# Groups:   AgeGroup [4]\n  AgeGroup Smoke `mean(LungCap)`\n  <chr>    <chr>           <dbl>\n1 14-15    no               9.14\n2 14-15    yes              8.39\n3 16-17    no              10.5 \n4 16-17    yes              9.38\n5 18+      no              11.1 \n6 18+      yes             10.5 \n7 Under 13 no               6.36\n8 Under 13 yes              7.20\n\n\nAfter using mutate() to add a column AgeGroup to a copy of smokers, group_by() groups the new dataset by AgeGroup and Smoke before piping it into a summarize() command to find the grouped means of LungCap by AgeGroup and Smoke.\nThe results show that for children above the age of 13, smokers had a lower mean lung capacity than non-smokers. However, for the 13 and under group, we again see results that imply smokers have greater lung capacity than nonsmokers. Let’s investigate further into the relationship between age and lung capacity to explain this quizzical result.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncov(og_lungcap$Age, og_lungcap$LungCap)\n\n\n[1] 8.738289\n\n\nCode\ncor(og_lungcap$Age, og_lungcap$LungCap)\n\n\n[1] 0.8196749\n\n\nCode\n#GGPlot of Age vs Lung\nggplot(og_lungcap, aes(x=Age, y=LungCap)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nAge and LungCap have a high covariance which leads to a high correlation (p=0.82). This strong positive value (-1<p<1) indicates these variables “vary greatly” together: when Age is high in the data, so is LungCap. We cannot say that an increase in Age causes an increase Lung capacity without first showing this through regression; however, our results show the variables are highly correlated.\nWe can use knowledge of the human body to infer that as our body ages, our lungs mature. The ages of smokers of the Under 13 group are likely highly left skewed, as I don’t expect many children under 10 to be smoking. This underlying age distribution explains our puzzling results from the previous section.\n\n\nCode\nsmokers_age%>%\n  group_by(AgeGroup, Smoke) %>%\n    summarize(mean(Age))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'AgeGroup'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n# Groups:   AgeGroup [4]\n  AgeGroup Smoke `mean(Age)`\n  <chr>    <chr>       <dbl>\n1 14-15    no          14.5 \n2 14-15    yes         14.6 \n3 16-17    no          16.4 \n4 16-17    yes         16.6 \n5 18+      no          18.5 \n6 18+      yes         18.1 \n7 Under 13 no           9.49\n8 Under 13 yes         11.7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s create two vectors: x_val and freq.

This is true in all categories except for Under 13, which is likely because smokers in that category are going to be older than nonsmokers in that category (i.e. it is more likely that a 12 year old smokes than a 6 year old, and a 12 year old has a larger lung capacity than a 6 year old regardless of smoking status)\nThis explains the first calculation of mean by smoking status (before finding the mean by age categories). Smokers are generally going to be older than non-smokers for this sample (the oldest participant in the sample is 19- see code below), which explains why the mean for smokers versus non-smokers (not separated by age categories) makes it look like smokers have a higher average lung capacity.\n\n\nCode\n#checking how old participants in the sample are\nlungcap %>% \n  summarize(range(Age))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 1\n  `range(Age)`\n         <dbl>\n1            3\n2           19\n\n\n\n\n1f.\nCalculating the correlation and covariance between Lung Capacity and Age:\n\n\nCode\n#Creating vectors of Age and Lung Capacity from df (lungcap) to apply cov() and cor() functions to\nx<-c(lungcap$Age)\ny<-c(lungcap$LungCap)\n\n\n#Calculating covariance\ncov(x, y)\n\n\n[1] 8.738289\n\n\nCode\n#calculating correlation\ncor(x, y)\n\n\n[1] 0.8196749\n\n\nThe covariance, 8.738 is fairly high and positive, meaning as age increases, so does lung capacity (i.e. age and lung capacity co-vary).
