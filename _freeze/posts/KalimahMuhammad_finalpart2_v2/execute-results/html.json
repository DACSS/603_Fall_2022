Early meta-analyses conducted by Hyde (1990) revealed no significant difference between the groups' cognitive abilities; yet intelligence and self-perception of ability, or self-esteem, were determined as the strongest predictors of academic success (Spinath et al., 2010, Booth and Gerard, 2011). Some research explains differences in achievement partially by stereotype threat (ST). Stereotype threat, originally used to research the vulnerability of racial stereotypes on aptitude tests, is defined as \"being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group\" (Steele and Aronson, 1995). Conventional research has focused on gender differences to stereotype threat (Moè & Putwain, 2020), and two prevailing theories have emerged.\n\nThe first theory suggests that ST affects male and female students differently. Here male students achieve better outcomes when stereotype threat is present than stereotype lift, and the reverse is true for female students who are adversely impacted by stereotype threat and positively impacted by stereotype lift (Johnson et al., 2012). Other studies debunk this theory suggesting no evidence of ST as a phenomenon in female students (Warne, 2022), particularly in the domain of mathematical achievement (Ganley et al., 2013). A second theory exists that the effects of ST may not be fully realized as outcomes immediately but affect achievement over time as chronic ST impacts working memory and intellectual helplessness in girls' math scores (Bedyńska, Krejtz, and Sedek, 2019) and male language arts scores (Bedyńska, Krejtz, and Sedek, 2020).\n\n## Research Questions\n\nThis study tests both theories. First, it questions if there are differences in predicted student achievement based on gender when exposed to negative stereotypes about males and positive stereotypes about females. Second, it evaluates the effect of the perceived prevalence of stereotypes as shown by the participants' exposure to three types of stereotype activation in predicting grades. The types of stereotype activation include:\n\n-   None: Participants were not exposed to stereotypes during this experiment.\n\n-   Case-based: Participants were shown three student profiles in which one female student had a high grade, and two male students had low grades.\n\n-   Statistics: Participants were shown statistics suggesting boys performed less well in school than girls.\n\nThis study tests the following hypotheses:\n\n**H1.** Does exposure to negative stereotypes about male achievement (ST) and positive stereotypes of female achievement (SL) result in higher predicted achievement among both male and female students?\n\n**H2.** Was there a statistically significant difference between predicted male and female achievement based on the type of stereotype activation?\n\n## Data\n\nData for this project was collected from Kaggle (Performance vs. Predicted Performance, 2022) and is a collection of existing student performance data from a study by Cortez and Silva (2008) on predicting secondary school student performance and the collector's addition of stereotype activation for machine learning. The data included information on actual student demographics such as gender, parents' highest level of education, as well as time studying vs. free time, number of absences, and grade on a final exam, among other variables.\n\nA few important variables to define include:\\\n-Index - number of students included in the original and predicted data (N=856 of the original 991 students)\\\n-Participant ID - number associated with participants making predictions (N=107)\\\n-Sex - student's sex (binary: 'F' - female or 'M' - male)\\\n-Studytime - weekly study time is categorized as 1= less than 2 hours, 2= 2-5 hours and 3= 5+ hours\\\n-Freetime - free time after school group as 1 = low, 2= medium, 3 = high\\\n-Goout - how often a student goes out with friends where 1 is very low and 4 is very often\\\n-Absences - number of school absences 1 - 7 where 7 represents any absences equal to or above 7\\\n-Walc - weekend alcohol consumption\\\n-Parents_edu - the higher of original variables mother's edu and father's edu, where 4 = the highest level of education\\\n-G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)\\\n-Reason - The reason for why a student chose to go to the school in question. The levels are close to home, school's reputation, school's curricular and other\\\n-PredictedGrade - the grade participants predicted based on actual data and their exposed level of StereotypeActivation\\\n-StereotypeActivation - see three levels of stereotype activation above\\\n-Pass - A binary variable showing whether G3 is a passing grade (i.e. \\>=10) or not\\\n-PassFailStrategy - A binary variable showing whether the PredictedGrade is a passing grade (i.e. \\>=10) or not\n\nAn additional variable I added to the data set, STPresent, identifies whether stereotype activation was present (True or False) for participants when predicting student scores.\n\nBelow is a summary of the variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#view top 5

distribution of male and female students (428 each), with 69% of participants exposed to some type of stereotype activation during grade prediction. The actual and predicted rate of passing are similar, 707 students passed versus the predicted 686, approximately 83% to 80% respectively. This may suggest other variables as strong indicators in passing. There is, however, a notable difference in the average actual scores (11.97) and predicted scores (13.14). This is further emphasized by the median actual scores (12) and predicted median (14). This early finding suggest that although the rate of passing was slightly lower, the overall predicted scores are skewed higher than actual.\n\nThe next two graphs compare the actual final grade vs. the predicted grade for both genders.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(performance, aes(x=G3, fill=sex))+ geom_histogram(position = \"dodge\")+labs(x=\"Students Actual Final Grade (G3)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

For male students, predicted scores increased in the presence of stereotype activation accounting for more low scores. Note, male scores were overall predicted lower than females independent of stereotype activation. Is there another variable contributing to this difference?\n\n## Hypothesis Testing\n\n### *H1.

The use of statistics garnered less significance for both genders, however still significant for predicting mean grades for female students. Once again the highest predicted scores for males were under conditions when ST was not present.\n\nComparing the two models, results are similar and there is minimal increase in the R-squared (0.053 to 0.056) and adjusted R-squared (0.050 to 0.051) for using sex as an explanatory variable vs. an interaction term. Residuals are also lower in model 3 than for model 2. The analysis of variance for the two models also confirms this result with lower RSS for model 3, minimizing residuals in the model. Thus model 3 is a better fit than model two.\n\n### Model 4 - Predicted Grades by Other Potential Explanatory Variables\n\nUntil now, I investigated stereotype activation as the primary explanatory variable in predicting grades for both genders. However, in both my hypothesis testing and previous models, this variable was not significant in comparing scores with or without the presence of stereotype activation. This next model explores which of the other variables could explain this phenomena including gender as an interaction term.\n\nVariables selected for exploration include:\n\n-Studytime - weekly study time is categorized as 1= less than 2 hours, 2= 2-5 hours and 3= 5+ hours\\\n-Freetime - free time after school group as 1 = low, 2= medium, 3 = high\\\n-Goout - how often a student goes out with friends where 1 is very low and 4 is very often\\\n-Absences - number of school absences 1 - 7 where 7 represents any absences equal to or above 7\\\n-Walc - weekend alcohol consumption\\\n-Parents_edu - the higher of original variables mother's edu and father's edu, where 4 = the highest level of education\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nperformance%>%\ngroup_by(sex)%>%\nsummarise(mean(studytime), mean(freetime), mean(goout), mean(absences),mean(G3), mean(PredictedGrade))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  sex   `mean(studytime)` `mean(freetime)` `mean(goout)` mean(…¹ mean(…² mean(…³\n  <chr>             <dbl>            <dbl>         <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 F                  2.07             2.07          2.99    2.70    12.1    14.0\n2 M                  1.71             2.30          3.05    2.89    11.8    12.3\n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​`mean(absences)`, ²​`mean(G3)`,\n#   ³​`mean(PredictedGrade)`\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above tables summarize differences in the mean values for several variables of interest by gender.

These would suggest female students may have a higher predicted grade based on good practices which is proven by the actual grades in G3 (12.15 vs. 11.80). However, there is larger discrepancies in predicted rages (14.0 for females vs. 12.28 for males).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#model other variables as possible explanatory variables \nmodel4 <-lm(PredictedGrade ~ (studytime + freetime + Walc + goout + Parents_edu + absences) * sex, data=performance)\nsummary(model4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = PredictedGrade ~ (studytime + freetime + Walc + \n    goout + Parents_edu + absences) * sex, data = performance)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-14.1916  -2.2127   0.2298   2.2908   9.5489 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

Based on the p-values, we also note study time, weekly alcohol consumption, parents education, and number of absences as most significant in predicting mean grades. Female students scored slighly more favorably in each of these areas than male students accounting a slight increase in actual grades as well. Thus perhaps participants over-estimated these values in predicting grades.\n\nComparing model 4 to model 3 using analysis of variance, there is a significant reduction in RSS and increase in p-value significance suggesting the introduction of these behavioral variables as a better fit for predicting grades than the introduction of stereotype activation. Note that in diagnosis the model 4 there are issues in normality (see the Cook's distance and Residuals vs. Leverage plots) as well as heteroskedasticity (see the Scale-Location plot). Since further evaluation of these variables are outside of the scope of this project, I will select model 3 for diagnostics.\n\n## Diagnostics\n\nFor this section, I will evaluate a few assumptions with model 3 which aimed to predict grades by the type of stereotype activation and the sex variable as an interaction term.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#create matrix of model plots\npar(mfrow = c(2,3)); plot(model3, which = 1:6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](KalimahMuhammad_finalpart2_v2_files/figure-html/diagnostics model 3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Normality of Errors -* In the Normal Q-Q plot, most observations fall close to the line assuming normality. Using the Cook's Distance and Residuals vs. Leverage, we can assume residuals are mostly normal as well with the exception of observation #62 whose leverage makes it an influential observation.\n\n*Linearity -* Viewing the Residuals vs. Fitted plot, we see a relatively straight and horizontal line suggesting the average residual for the fitted values are relatively similar. Note, there are three observations, #62, #348, and #742 that are identified as outliers.\n\n*Equal Variance of Errors* - Although the Residuals vs. Fitted plot show a near equal variance of the error terms based on its straight and horizontal line, the Scale-Location plot shows a decreasing rather than flat trend as the fitted values increase.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, stereotype activation has some influence in predicting higher scores for certain groups under certain conditions but was not a statistically significant predictor in grades for either male or female students based on this experiment. In this study, stereotypes favored female students over male students. Where this stereotype was present for both case based and statistic stereotypes, there was an increase in female predicted scores versus when ST was absent. Predictions for male grades also benefited from a higher predicted score when ST was absent. This does suggest there is some bias introduced with stereotype activation but not enough to be statistically significant in predicting grades.\n\nA more robust model for predicting grades (model 4) incorporated student behavioral factors such as study time, weekly alcohol consumption, and number of school absences as well demographic factors such as parents education. Future research should further investigate these variables as well as test the inverse of the stereotype which would favor male students. Overall, participants generally predicted grades higher for both genders compared to actual but the average predicted scores were not statistically significant based on stereotype activation.\n\n#### Sources\n\nBedyńska, S., Krejtz, I. & Sedek, G.
