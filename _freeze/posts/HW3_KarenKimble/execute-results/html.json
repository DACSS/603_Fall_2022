There are very many high values of fertility rate on the very low end of the x axis, but then this sharply changes between 10,000 and 20,000.\n\n### Part 3\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(log(fertility) ~ log(ppgdp), data = UN11, main=\"Log of Fertility by Log of GDP per Capita\", xlab = \"Log of GDP per Capita\", ylab = \"Log of Fertility Rate per 1000 Females\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_KarenKimble_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing the logs of each variable results in a different graph where a straight line would fit better than in the previous graph. A simple linear regression model seems plausible here.\n\n## Question 2\n\n### Part A\n\nThe slope of the prediction equation might decrease because the British pound is worth more U.S. dollars, so the slope would be increasing by the same number of units (for both 1.33 U.S. dollars and 1 British pound) but over a larger span of the x-axis.\n\n### Part B\n\nThe correlation would not change because the relationship between annual income and the dependent/response variable is the same regardless of units of measurement.\n\n## Question 3\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npairs(water, upper.panel = NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_KarenKimble_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like there has been a lot more runoff at the OPRC, OPSLAKE, BSAAM, and APSLAkE in recent years. Runoff in the earliest years seemed to me more random and spread out.\n\n## Question 4\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npairs(Rateprof[,8:12], upper.panel = NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_KarenKimble_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like as the ratings of professors' quality of teaching increased, helpfulness and clarity ratings also increased. However, easiness and interest ratings don't seem to be as correalted with these variables.\n\n## Question 5\n\n### Political Ideology vs Religiosity\n\n#### Part A\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(student.survey)\nstudent.survey$pi <- unclass(student.survey$pi)\nstudent.survey$re <- unclass(student.survey$re)\n\n# In the political ideology variable, very conservative = 7 and very liberal = 1\n\n# In the religiosity variable, attending religious services every week = 4, and never = 1\n\nplot(pi ~ re, data = student.survey, main = \"Political Ideology by Religiosity\", xlab = \"Religiousity\", ylab = \"Political Ideology\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_KarenKimble_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Part B\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit1 <- lm(pi ~ re, data = student.survey)\nsummary(fit1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pi ~ re, data = student.survey)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.81243 -0.87160  0.09882  1.12840  3.09882 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The p-value for religiosity is much smaller than the alpha value of 0.05, indicating that there is statistically significant evidence showing religiosity affects students' political ideology. The two are positively related, meaning that, within the regression model, for an increase in religiosity (attending more religious services) by 1, there is a 0.97 increase in political ideology (more conservative or less liberal).\n\n### High School GPA versus TV Watching\n\n#### Part A\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(hi ~ tv, data = student.survey, main = \"High School GPA by Hours of TV Watched\", xlab = \"Avg Hours/Week Watching TV\", ylab = \"High School GPA\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_KarenKimble_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Part B\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit2 <- lm(hi ~ tv, data = student.survey)\nsummary(fit2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = hi ~ tv, data = student.survey)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.2583 -0.2456  0.0417  0.3368  0.7051 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

The p-value for hours of TV is less than the alpha value of 0.05, indicating that there is statistically significant evidence showing TV watching affects students' high school GPA. The variables are negatively related: for every hour of TV watched per week (on average), there is a 0.018 decrease in high school GPA based on the regression model.\n",
