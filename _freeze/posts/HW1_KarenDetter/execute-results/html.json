The one exception is the 13 and under age category - here, mean lung capacity is actually higher for smokers. This anomaly could be due to the fact that the number of observations is significantly higher for this age group than any of the others, likely resulting in a wider range of lung capacities. Also, this age category, which includes ages 3 through 13, covers a broader scope of ages than any of the other categories, likely producing the paradox of a smaller number of smokers exhibiting higher lung capacities than their cohorts simply because they are older. \n\n# Q.1f\n## Calculate correlation and covariance between lung capacity and age\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor(LungCapData$LungCap, LungCapData$Age)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8196749\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncov(LungCapData$LungCap, LungCapData$Age)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 8.738289\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nSince the correlation coefficient is close to 1, there is a high degree of correlation between lung capacity and age. The covariance of 8.7, being a positive number, indicates that as age increases, lung capacity increases. \n\n\n# Q.2a\n## Create data frame\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPriorConv <- c(0,1,2,3,4)\nFreq <- c(128,434,160,64,24)\nPrisonerData <- data.frame (PriorConv, Freq)\nPrisonerData\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  PriorConv Freq\n1         0  128\n2         1  434\n3         2  160\n4         3   64\n5         4   24\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Calculate probability that an inmate has == 2 prior convictions\n\nprobability = frequency/n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n160/810\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.1975309\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n# Q.2b\n## Calculate probability that an inmate has < 2 prior convictions\n\nprobability = frequency(0)/n + frequency(1)/n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(128/810) + (434/810)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.6938272\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Q.2c\n## Calculate probability that an inmate has <= 2 prior convictions\n\nprobability = frequency(0)/n + frequency(1)/n + frequency(2)/n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(128/810) + (434/810) + (160/810)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.891358\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Q.2d\n## Calculate probability that an inmate has > 2 prior convictions\n\nprobability = frequency(3)/n + frequency(4)/n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(64/810) + (24/810)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.108642\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Q.2e\n\n## Calculate expected value for number of prior convictions\n## Create a matrix of prior conviction values and their probabilities\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPriorConv <- c(0,1,2,3,4)\nProbs <- c(0.1580247, 0.5358025, 0.1975309, 0.07901235, 0.02962963)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Calculate expected value\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(PriorConv %*% Probs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.28642\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Q.2f\n## Calculate variance and standard deviation for prior convictions\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvar(PriorConv)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2.5\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(PriorConv)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.581139\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Double-check values\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(var(PriorConv)) == sd(PriorConv)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
