In the 13 and under group, however, mean lung capacity is actually higher for smokers. This anomaly could be due to the fact that the number of observations is significantly higher for this age group than any of the others, likely resulting in wider variations in lung capacity. In addition, this category covers ages from 2 through 13, meaning that the minimum values are likely to be quite low and could skew the distribution to the left.\n\n# Q.1f\n## calculate correlation and covariance between lung capacity and age\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor(LungCapData$LungCap, LungCapData$Age)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8196749\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncov(LungCapData$LungCap, LungCapData$Age)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 8.738289\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nSince the correlation coefficient is close to 1, there is a high degree of correlation between lung capacity and age.
