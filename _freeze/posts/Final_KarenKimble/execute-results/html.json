I think this is extremely important to look at because of the pandemic's impact on not only child learning but also families' economic resources. According to the Columbia University Center on Poverty and Social Policy, \"nearly a quarter of children ages 0-3 live in poverty and nearly half of the city's young children live in lower-opportunity neighborhoods where the poverty rate is at least 20 percent\" (\"Poverty\"). Unfortunately, research shows that poverty is disproportionately felt according to one's race or ethnicity. In New York State, as of 2021, child poverty among children of color is almost 30%, with Black or African American children more than twice as likely to live in poverty than White, Non-Hispanic children (\"New York State\", 2021). With this disproportionate level of economic need in children of color, it seems important to investigate if the poverty level within New York City schools that are predominately non-White has increased significantly compared to schools that are predominantly White. When searching the UMass Libraries databases and other sources, it was hard to find studies that used this data in this way. It is important to understand if there is increasing poverty levels within an already vulnerable group.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nI hypothesize that the poverty rate in NYC schools that are predominantly children of color will have increased more between pre- and post-Covid than the poverty rate in schools that are predominantly White. Since I have not found many previous studies on this, it is hard to know if this hypothesis was tested before. However, this data is fairly recent and also relates to the pandemic's effects on economics, so I think it is still a significant contribution to test this hypothesis.\n\n## Descriptive Statistics\n\nA description and summary of your data. How was your data collected by its original collectors? What are the important variables of interest for your research question? Use functions like glimpse() and summary() to present your data.\n\nThe data was collected by New York City and put on its Open Data source. The data covers NYC schools in the academic years 2014-2015 to 2020-2021. The important variables of interest included in the data are:\n\n-   Academic year, which I transformed into pre-Covid and post-Covid variables\n\n-   Number and percentage of Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White students\n\n-   Number and percentage of students in poverty\n\n-   Economic need index, which is the average of students' \"Economic Need Values\"\n\n    -   The Economic Need Index (ENI) estimates the percentage of students facing economic hardship\n\nThe other variables included are: DBN (district, borough, school number), school name, total enrollment, enrollment numbers for K-12, number and percentage of female and male students, number and percentage of students with disabilities, and number and percentage of English-Language Learner (ELL) students.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

Schools with more white students may have received more support during Covid, whether directly to the school or to the students themselves.\n\nNull Hypothesis: The percentage of students in poverty is the same both pre- and post-Covid for both majority and minority white school districts.\n\nAlternative Hypothesis: The percentage of students in poverty is higher post-Covid than pre-Covid, and this effect will be more drastic in minority white school districts than in majority white school districts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(post_white$pct_poverty) - mean(pre_white$pct_poverty)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -0.9168508\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(post_nonwhite$pct_poverty) - mean(pre_nonwhite$pct_poverty)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.4610488\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(post$pct_poverty) - mean(pre$pct_poverty)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8529465\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBefore conducting the hypothesis test, we already see that the differences between pre- and post-Covid poverty levels are very different for majority white and majorty nonwhite schools. Majority white schools actually had a decrease in poverty of 0.91% between pre-Covid and post-Covid school years. Yet majority nonwhite schools saw poverty increase between pre- and post-Covid by 0.46%. All school districts saw an overall 0.85% poverty increase in this time period. However, these numbers could be skewed since there is only one post-Covid year while there are a lot of years included in the data-set pre-Covid.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Hypothesis Test\n\nmodel <- lm(pct_poverty ~ Post_Covid + pct_white + Post_Covid * pct_white, data = school_data)\nsummary(model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pct_poverty ~ Post_Covid + pct_white + Post_Covid * \n    pct_white, data = school_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-53.760  -7.076   1.633   8.534  46.497 \n\nCoefficients:\n                      Estimate Std.

However, the p-value for the variable of the percentage of white students remains much smaller than the 0.05 significance level.
