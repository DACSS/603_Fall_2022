And the covariance between lung capacity and age is 8.738. Correlation gets stronger the closer the value gets to 1 or -1; the correlation between lung capacity and age for 'LungCap' dataset is 0.820, a figure relatively close to 1, so I would say there is a moderate to strong correlation between the two variables in question here.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#Question 2  \n###Let X=number of prior convictions for prisoners at a state prison at which there are 810 inmates.\n\n\n## 2a.
