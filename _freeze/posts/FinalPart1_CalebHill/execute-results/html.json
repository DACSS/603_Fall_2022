Specifically, racial characteristics play a large role in predicting re-hospitalization in a population (Li, Cai & Glance, 2015). While some articles examine economic and health factors contributing to these disparities, very few dig deep into environmental factors that influence this phenomenon, (Spatz, Bernheim, Horwitz & Herrin, 2020). With your zipcode affecting up to 60% of your health outcomes, this research is relevant to better improving one of our most costly health expenditures: hospitalization.\n\nThis paper aims to explore how different environmental variables impact re-hospitalization rates on a county-by-county level, controlling for racial, ethnic, and sex variables (maybe). These environmental factors will include both common environmental concerns, such as heat index, average temperature, precipitation, and natural disasters, along with the built environment, population density.\n\nThe data-set chosen for this analysis is taken from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Database. This data-set has over 300 variables to explore each SDOH domain: social context, economic context, education, healthcare, and the environment. We shall pull data from three of these five domains: social, economic, and environmental.\n\nTo further reduce data bloat, we shall limit the geographic review to Texas counties -- my home state! That should provide us with 200+ observations.\n\nThe hypothesis for this research report is: \\*Environmental factors increase rates of re-hospitalization in Texas counties.\n\nTherefore, the null hypothesis is: \\*Environmental factors do not increase rates of re-hospitalization in Texas counties.\n\nMultiple regression analyses shall be employed to determine the relationship -- or lack thereof -- between these variables.\n\nFirst I'll import the relevant libraries.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThen I'll import the dataset and view the first six rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- SDOH_2020_COUNTY_1_0 <- read_excel(\"_data/SDOH_2020_COUNTY_1_0.xlsx\", sheet = \"Data\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OA1673 / R1673C391: got '46123'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OA1765 / R1765C391: got '32510'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OB1765 / R1765C392: got '41025'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OC1765 / R1765C393: got '41037'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OA2799 / R2799C391: got '49017'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OB2799 / R2799C392: got '49019'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OC2799 / R2799C393: got '49025'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OD2799 / R2799C394: got '49055'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OA2844 / R2844C391: got '51760'\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 685\n   YEAR COUNTYFIPS STATEFIPS STATE COUNTY REGION TERRI…¹ ACS_T…² ACS_T…³ ACS_T…⁴\n  <dbl> <chr>      <chr>     <chr> <chr>  <chr>    <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n1  2020 01001      01        Alab… Autau… South        0   55639   54929   52404\n2  2020 01003      01        Alab… Baldw… South        0  218289  216518  206329\n3  2020 01005      01        Alab… Barbo… South        0   25026   24792   23694\n4  2020 01007      01        Alab… Bibb … South        0   22374   22073   21121\n5  2020 01009      01        Alab… Bloun… South        0   57755   57164   54250\n6  2020 01011      01        Alab… Bullo… South        0   10173   10143    9579\n# … with 675 more variables: ACS_TOT_POP_ABOVE15 <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_POP_ABOVE16 <dbl>, ACS_TOT_POP_16_19 <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_POP_ABOVE25 <dbl>, ACS_TOT_CIVIL_POP_ABOVE18 <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_CIVIL_VET_POP_ABOVE25 <dbl>, ACS_TOT_OWN_CHILD_BELOW17 <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_WORKER_NWFH <dbl>, ACS_TOT_WORKER_HH <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_CIVILIAN_LABOR <dbl>, ACS_TOT_CIVIL_EMPLOY_POP <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_POP_POV <dbl>, ACS_TOT_CIVIL_NONINST_POP_POV <dbl>, …\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext I want to verify the class is a dataframe.

Most counties have poverty rates ranging from 10% to 20%. There are of course out-liers, especially a good number below 10%, but those are rare.\n\n### Re-hospitalization Rate\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data, aes(LTC_AVG_OBS_REHOSP_RATE)) +   geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](FinalPart1_CalebHill_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother right skewed variable. Lots of counties with 0.00 rates of re-hospitalization, and few, if any, above 0.25 per 100,000 people. From a health perspective, this is good news! From a research perspective, that's going to make analysis a little trickier. However, the somewhat normal and/or bimodal distribution should be fairly easy to work with, needing little to no transformation for a linear regression.\n\n### Correlation\n\nFinally, let's plot a brief correlation matrix to see if there's any relationships we can explore as a simple linear regression in the next section.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata %>%\n  cor(data) %>%\n  corrplot(is.corr = FALSE, method=\"number\", tl.cex = .4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](FinalPart1_CalebHill_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe closer a box is to 1, the higher the correlation. Not particularly exciting news, as it shows there's not a high correlation between re-hospitalization rates and any of the explanatory variables. This may throw a kink in our analysis -- and explain why others haven't delved deeply into this research!\n\nPerhaps this step should have been completed first, but nonetheless, we shall continue on with the report. I may pull two more environmental variables, to see if we can find a correlation somewhere. Even so, the sum total of all environmental variables might contribute to re-hospitalization rates as well. I'm just not sure if that -- along with control variables -- is outside the scope of this report.\n\nFor Part 2, I'd like to rename the variables to more digestible phrases, and I would like to overhaul the code outputs, to make the tables and visualizations a little easier on the eyes. That's just polish work, though, and won't affect the analysis.\n\nLooking over the Spatz et. al. (2020) article again, the two most significant Built Environment variables (with the highest R2 value) are 1) Long Commute, Driving Alone and 2) Severe Housing Problems. I'm going to scour the SDOH data-set to see what relevant variables match these two and add them into Part 2.\n\n## References\n\nBarnett, M., Hsu, J. & McWilliams, M.
