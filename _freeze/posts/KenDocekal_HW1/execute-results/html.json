For the two lowest age groups mean capacity is lower for non-smokers although the difference decreases as age increases; this trend is reversed from age 16 onwards as non-smokers overtake smokers in lung capacity. Across all age groups non-smokers also have a greater standard deviation in lung capacity compared to smokers with the age 13 and under non-smoker group having the greatest standard deviation. It is likely that the greater number of age 13 and under respondents is the reason why overall results mirror the distribution seen in the youngest age group.\n\n\n\n## f\n\nCovariance between lung capacity and age:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncov(LungCapData$Age,LungCapData$LungCap)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 8.738289\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nA positive covariance is shown which lets us know that as age increases lung capacity also increases.\n\n\n\nCorrelation between lung capacity and age:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor(LungCapData$Age,LungCapData$LungCap)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8196749\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe correlation coefficient is also positive; similar to the covariance this lets us know that there is a positive relationship between age and lung capacity. Additionally, since .819 is a relatively high score, as a score of 1 would indicate a perfect positive relationship, we know there is a strong relationship where a older respondent would be highly likely to have higher lung capacity and a younger respondent would likely have lower lung capacity. \n\n\n\n\n# Question 2\n\n## a\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected inmate has exactly 2 prior\nconvictions:\n\nCreate data frame:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconvictions<- c(0,1,2,3,4)\nprisoners<- c(128, 434, 160, 64, 24)\n\ndf <- data.frame(convictions, prisoners)\n\ntibble(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  convictions prisoners\n        <dbl>     <dbl>\n1           0       128\n2           1       434\n3           2       160\n4           3        64\n5           4        24\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nProbability of exactly 2 prior convictions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n160/sum(prisoners)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.1975309\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## b\n\nProbability of fewer than 2 prior convictions (total # of prisoners with less than 2 prior convictions = 562):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n562/sum(prisoners)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.6938272\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## c\n\nProbability of 2 or fewer prior convictions (total # of prisoners with 2 or fewer prior convictions = 722):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n722/sum(prisoners)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.891358\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## d\n\nProbability of more than 2 prior convictions (total # of prisoners with more than 2 prior convictions = 88):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n88/sum(prisoners)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.108642\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## e\n\nThe expected value for the number of prior convictions (using the probability of observing each prisoner prior conviction group):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncon1<- c(0,1,2,3,4)\npprob<- c(.158,.536,.198,.079,.028)\n\n\nsum(con1*pprob)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.281\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## f\n\nVariance and standard deviation for prior convictions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvar(prisoners)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 25948\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(prisoners)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 161.0838\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
