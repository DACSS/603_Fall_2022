I found some data sets for my DACSS-601 intensive final that were pretty useful - I found a lot of information but now that I will have the statistical background I'd like to see if I can go further with it. Specifically in the sense of finding out statistics related to the likelihood of an eruption of ethnic violence in countries that fit specific criteria on paper. I can come up with a different research question for this topic area if my initial idea isn't feasible though.  \n\n#These criteria are as follows:  \n# - The population doesn't have an overwhelming ethnic majority; there are 2+ groups, each with substantial numbers.  \n# - History of socio-political repression by one group against the other(s) when said group has political power/alternating episodes of targeted political repression depending on what group holds a political majority.  \n# - The country/population is in a state of severe socio-political instability (war, territorial conquest, political power vacuum, etc.)  \n\n#To make this a little less challenging, I'm going to simplify things for myself. First, I will narrow the data down geographically and temporally - I'm going to focus on former Yugoslav states and the former USSR (I might change the location though). Second, since the data sets I'll be using are pretty big, I'm also going to look at certain columns based on the criteria I presented above (ethnic groups involved, group(s) being oppressed and by whom, and presence/absence of political instability). \n\n# Research Question: Based on what the data show, (1) is there actually a higher probability of ethnic armed conflict/war when these conditions, and (2) does one particular condition have a greater effect on political stability than the others?\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(poliscidata)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'gdata':\n  method         from  \n  reorder.factor gplots\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(foreign)\n```\n:::\n\n\n##Summary Stats/Visuals \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#All data sets I will be using are from the Harvard Dataverse and they are as follows:  \n\n#     Lars-Erik Cederman; Brian Min; Andreas Wimmer, 2010, \"Ethnic Power Relations dataset\", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NDJUJM, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:5:k4xxXC2ASI204QZ4jqvUrQ== [fileUNF]  \n#     Lars-Erik Cederman; Brian Min; Andreas Wimmer, 2010, \"Ethnic Armed Conflict dataset\", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/K3OIJQ, Harvard Dataverse, V1  \n#    UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 22.1.
