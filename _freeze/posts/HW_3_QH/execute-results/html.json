While it has a similar trend line to the previous graph, I still do not think viewing the data with logs is an accurate way to represent the relationship between the two variables.\n\nAlthough I suppose it would be practical on second thought because it's clearly showing what the above graph is trying to display. This is a more drastic negative correlation.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(UN11, mapping = aes(x = log(UN11$ppgdp), y = log(UN11$fertility)))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW_3_QH_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## 2a\n\nThis question is a bit challenge but I think the slope would decrease because the exchange rate decreases with conversion. \n\n## 2b\n\nThe correlation wouldn't change because the strength of the relationship isn't affected.\n\n## 3\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(pairs(water[2:8]))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW_3_QH_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLength  Class   Mode \n     0   NULL   NULL \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nBSAAM to OPBPC seem to be positively correlated with each other. This leads me to think that OPBPC, OPRC and OPSLAKE have significant runoff because the high level of precipitation is positively correlated with the volume of runoff measured by BSAAM.\n\n\n## 4\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npairs(Rateprof[8:12])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW_3_QH_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nAccording to the scatter plot matrix, we can observe a few relationships of the various entries. Helpfulness and quality have a strong positive correlation. Clarity and quality and helpfulness and clarity also have a very strong positive correlation, all of which is expected. It's when easiness comes it there is less positive correlation. I would imagine easiness and clarity would have a stronger correlation but here there appears to be less of a positive relationship. \n\nraterInterest is the variable with the least correlation with any of the other variables. \n\n## 5\nCreating dummy variables.
