Across time and places, there is a clear negative link between women's education and fertility, although its meaning is ambiguous. Women's level of education may impact fertility through its effects on children's health, the number of children desired, and women's ability to give birth and understanding of various birth control options. Each of these are influenced by local, institutional, and national circumstances. Their relative importance may fluctuate as a society develops economically. Since having children affects how much mothers must pay for childcare, women's education may also be correlated with fertility. The data was acquired from various years of the National Opinion Resource Center’s General Social Survey.\nCompared to other women, mothers who stay at home with their kids are less likely to invest more money in their education. The correlation between women's education and unobservable qualities that are jointly linked with fertility may be even more significant.\n\n###Hypothesis\nIt can be thought of as the total number of unplanned and intended children. The number of kids a family can have, the number of kids the family desires, and the capability to regulate birth through the availability of modern contraceptives and the knowledge of how to use them are all impacted by advancements in women's education. The number of children a woman has is halfway between the amount she wants and her level of natural fertility. Age and fertility control are the determining variables.If there was a variation by region in birth control availability, such information might be valuable. However, our data set does not contain geographical information (parameters). \nMy assumption would be that if the level of education increases, the number of children would decrease.\n\n\n:::
