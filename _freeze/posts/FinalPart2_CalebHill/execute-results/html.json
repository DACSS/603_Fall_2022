Specifically, racial characteristics play a large role in predicting re-hospitalization in a population (Li, Cai & Glance, 2015). While some articles examine economic and health factors contributing to these disparities, very few dig deep into environmental factors that influence this phenomenon, (Spatz, Bernheim, Horwitz & Herrin, 2020). With your zipcode affecting up to 60% of your health outcomes, this research is relevant to better improving one of our most costly health expenditures: hospitalization.\n\nRe-hospitalization is a substantially costlier expenditure, as readmitting a patient further increases costs -- especially if the diagnosis was untreated, poorly treated, or incorrectly treated. Most inpatient episodes characterized as a re-hospitalization when the patient is readmitted to the hospital 60 days after discharge. If the cause is different, sometimes that is counted as a re-hospitalization; other times, not so much, (Bhosale, K., Nath, R., Pandit, N., Agarwal, P., Khairnar, S., Yadav, B. & Chandrakar, S., 2020).\n\n### Research Question\n\nThis paper aims to explore how different environmental variables impact re-hospitalization rates on a county-by-county level. Due to the nature of this project, we will not be controlling for racial, ethnic, and sex variables. These environmental factors will include both common environmental concerns, such as heat index, average temperature, precipitation, and natural disasters, along with the built environment, mean travel time to work, renter burden, and population density. We will also stratify by rural/urban classification, to determine if counties above or below 250,000 population experience differences in re-hospitalization rates, dependent upon these explanatory variables.\n\nThe data-set chosen for this analysis is taken from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Database. This data-set has over 300 variables to explore each SDOH domain: social context, economic context, education, healthcare, and the environment. We shall pull data from three of these five domains: social, economic, and environmental.\n\nHow re-hospitalization is measured is not clarified per this data-set's codebook. However, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) 30-day Risk-Standardized Readmission Rate (RSRR) measures re-hospitalization as an unplanned readmission to inpatient services. It does stratify and specify based upon diagnosis. As the AHRQ is a federal agency alongside CMS, it is likely that they are pulling from CMS for this measure and aggregating various diagnoses into one county rate.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe hypothesis for this research report is:\n\n-   Environmental factors increase rates of re-hospitalization in the United States.\n\nTherefore, the null hypothesis is:\n\n-   Environmental factors do not increase rates of re-hospitalization in the United States.\n\nVarious regression analyses shall be employed to determine the relationship -- or lack thereof -- between these variables.\n\nFirst I'll import the relevant libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I'll import the dataset and view the first six rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- SDOH_2020_COUNTY_1_0 <- read_excel(\"_data/SDOH_2020_COUNTY_1_0.xlsx\", \n                                         sheet = \"Data\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OA1673 / R1673C391: got '46123'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OA1765 / R1765C391: got '32510'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OB1765 / R1765C392: got '41025'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OC1765 / R1765C393: got '41037'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OA2799 / R2799C391: got '49017'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OB2799 / R2799C392: got '49019'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OC2799 / R2799C393: got '49025'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OD2799 / R2799C394: got '49055'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Expecting logical in OA2844 / R2844C391: got '51760'\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 685\n   YEAR COUNTYFIPS STATEFIPS STATE COUNTY REGION TERRI…¹ ACS_T…² ACS_T…³ ACS_T…⁴\n  <dbl> <chr>      <chr>     <chr> <chr>  <chr>    <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n1  2020 01001      01        Alab… Autau… South        0   55639   54929   52404\n2  2020 01003      01        Alab… Baldw… South        0  218289  216518  206329\n3  2020 01005      01        Alab… Barbo… South        0   25026   24792   23694\n4  2020 01007      01        Alab… Bibb … South        0   22374   22073   21121\n5  2020 01009      01        Alab… Bloun… South        0   57755   57164   54250\n6  2020 01011      01        Alab… Bullo… South        0   10173   10143    9579\n# … with 675 more variables: ACS_TOT_POP_ABOVE15 <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_POP_ABOVE16 <dbl>, ACS_TOT_POP_16_19 <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_POP_ABOVE25 <dbl>, ACS_TOT_CIVIL_POP_ABOVE18 <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_CIVIL_VET_POP_ABOVE25 <dbl>, ACS_TOT_OWN_CHILD_BELOW17 <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_WORKER_NWFH <dbl>, ACS_TOT_WORKER_HH <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_CIVILIAN_LABOR <dbl>, ACS_TOT_CIVIL_EMPLOY_POP <dbl>,\n#   ACS_TOT_POP_POV <dbl>, ACS_TOT_CIVIL_NONINST_POP_POV <dbl>, …\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext I want to verify the class is a dataframe.

From a research perspective, that's going to make analysis a little trickier. However, the somewhat normal and/or bimodal distribution should be fairly easy to work with. While needing some transformation for a linear regression, we can test multiple models per each variable to determine which amendment provides the most robust inference.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Hypothesis Testing\n\nRemember that the hypothesis for this research report is:\n\n-   Environmental factors increase rates of re-hospitalization in the United States.\n\nWe have nine (9) explanatory variables to work with, so we can run different regressions to determine what variables influence re-hospitalization rates the most -- if at all -- and how they interact with other variables.\n\nReminder that the nine (9) explanatory variable are broken down into three domains: environmental, economic, and built environment.\n\nEnvironmental entails:\n\n-   Day with Heat Index over 105F\n\n-   Average Annual Precipitation\n\n-   Average Annual Precipitation\n\n-   Total Natural Disasters Per Year\n\nEconomic is:\n\n-   Median Household Income\n\n-   Percent Poverty\n\nAnd the Built Environment includes:\n\n-   Population Density\n\n-   Percent Rental Housing Cost, over 50%\n\n-   Percent Commuting Alone, over 60 minutes\n\nWe will run four models to test the hypothesis. They shall examine each environmental variable's impact on the dependent variable, re-hospitalization rates.

This is very apparent for our three out-liers. The remaining plots do not violate their tested assumptions and further cement the model's reliability.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper explored the relationship between re-hospitalization rates and four environmental variables, when controlling for common variables that regularly influence the dependent variable. These four variables included days with a heat index over 105F, average annual temperature, average annual precipitation, and total natural disasters.\n\nFour models were selected, one for each variable, to best determine which measure best impacted re-hospitalization rates. Three of the four variables were statistically significant and two had a larger adjusted R squared value than the others. Precipitation was selected as the variable with the best model fit to explain re-hospitalization rate impact. While the adjusted R-squared value is negligible (0.06), there is a positive relationship that is statistically significant. Therein we see some form of an influence large amounts of annual precipitation has on re-hospitalization rates.\n\nI would have liked to tighten the analysis further instead of including multiple (10) variables, by focusing on some key measurements: Precipitation as the explanatory, Poverty as the control, and filtering by Rurality to determine the relationship with re-hospitalization rates. I could then fit different models (Simple Linear, Poisson, Polynomial, etc.) to see which worked best. I may not have time to do so for the poster presentation, nor would that perhaps be within the scope of this project. Either way, I have something for future classes, perhaps via time series analysis or machine learning (prediction over inference). Either way, this helped me better understand the robustness of linear regression models.\n\n## References\n\nBarnett, M., Hsu, J. & McWilliams, M.
