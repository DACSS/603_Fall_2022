Identifying antecedents of affective polarization is essential to creating intervention strategies into this negative state of politics. Levendusky (2009) proposes a social model where individuals making sense of simplified elite cues enables people to understand the relevant identities of the political landscape, which may lead to downstream affective polarization. I intend to expand on this model, testing a construct of construal level, or the level of abstraction to concreteness (Trope & Liberman, 2010) with which partisans perceive partisan groups and group cues. This levels varies in how individuals describe different constructs as having more concrete or abstract characteristics, such as mentioning specific groups as opposed to vague ideological concepts (view the Appendix at the bottom for more information on how this was qualitatively coded). Prior studies suggest that lower construal may serve as an antecedent to affective polarization when partisans view issues in more concrete, group terms (Snyder, Unpublished). This study will expand these models into extant, large scale, political science datasets. Additionally, this project will employ supervised machine learning models to qualitatively code a large-n sample of free response questions.\n\n## Hypotheses\nI hypothesize that partisans who are qualitatively coded as having a lower construal level will demonstrate higher levels of group/affective polarization, as measured on a feeling thermometer or measures of feelings about political groups - whichever is available in the datasets.\n\nI hypothesize that using a sentiment analysis, these tendencies may be moderated by valence of their free response, with stronger valence enhancing the effect of construal level on affective polarization - valence being the psychological term for positive vs negative sentiment.\n\n## Datasets\nI intend to use UMass Poll, ANES, and Polarization Research Lab datasets for my studies. UMass Poll data will be used for Study 1, which is shown in the initial analyses here. Studies 2 and 3 will include data (that will be collected later in November) obtained from an accepted application for survey space from Dartmouth's Polarization Research Lab. ANES data, specifically the free response questions in 1992, will be used to compare the qualitative coding results of the free responses to Mason's social sorting measures. I hope you will forgive me not having all of these results right now, as I will need to hand code 2000+ cases before these studies are over, and some of the data has not been collected yet, but should be before the Final Project is due.\n\n#Analyses\nAs mentioned in the previous section, initial analyses have been performed to test the first hypothesis. UMass Poll data has been qualitatively coded and analyzed for this purpose. In order to measure the effectiveness of the qualitative coding, multiple models and portions of variables were compared.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Clean Data\ndoto <- read_sav(\"12_21_Data.sav\")\ncaitCode <- read_csv(\"CaitlynQualCodingCP.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 815 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): Response\ndbl (4): Resp#, Who, How, model1\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndCode <- read_csv(\"qualCodingCRTno99.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nNew names:\nRows: 815 Columns: 6\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(1): Who, shows a concrete understanding of group information dbl (4):\nrespondent, Who, How, model1 lgl (1): ...5\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -> `...5`\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndoto <- subset(doto, doto$Q33_open != \"__NA__\")\nRdoto <- subset(doto, doto$pid3lean == \"Republicans\")\nDdoto <- subset(doto, doto$pid3lean == \"Democrats\")\nIdoto <- subset(doto, doto$pid3lean == \"Independents\")\n\ndoto$affPol <- doto$Q10_democrats - doto$Q10_republicans\ndoto$CCModel2 <- caitCode$model1\ncaitCode$whoOrHow <- recode(caitCode$model1, \"0\" = \"0\", .default = \"1\")\ndoto$CCModel <- caitCode$whoOrHow\ndoto$absAffPol <- abs(doto$affPol)\ndoto$dummy <- rep(\"Dummy\", 815)\n\ndata <- aggregate(absAffPol ~ CCModel2, doto, mean)\npartyData <- aggregate(absAffPol ~ CCModel2 + pid3lean, doto, mean)\npartyData <- partyData[-(1:3),]\ndata$CCModel2 <- recode(data$CCModel2, \"2\" = \"Low Construal\", \"1\" = \"Medium Construal\", \"0\" = \"High Construal\")\ndata$CCModel2 <- factor(data$CCModel2, levels = c(\"High Construal\", \"Medium Construal\", \"Low Construal\"))\n\npartyData$CCModel2 <- recode(partyData$CCModel2, \"2\" = \"Low Construal\", \"1\" = \"Medium Construal\", \"0\" = \"High Construal\")\npartyData$CCModel2 <- factor(partyData$CCModel2, levels = c(\"High Construal\", \"Medium Construal\", \"Low Construal\"))\n\n#Plot Data\nggplot(data = data, aes(x = CCModel2, y = absAffPol)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](FinalProjectPart2_DonnySnyder_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = partyData, aes(x = CCModel2, y = absAffPol, fill = pid3lean)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Democrats\" = \"#00405b\", \"Independents\" = \"#4F7942\", \"Republicans\" = \"#7d0000\")) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](FinalProjectPart2_DonnySnyder_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#comparison of regression models (1 is the best model)\nmodel1 <- lm(formula = absAffPol ~ CCModel2 + educ + newsint, data = doto)\nsummary(model1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = absAffPol ~ CCModel2 + educ + newsint, data = doto)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-62.961 -22.197   2.562  21.240  70.032 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

It is the most significant of any of the variables, and this significance does not disappear when put into a multiple regression model with other explanatory variables, both of Affective Polarization and of other qualitative coding models/combinations. Both the \"Who\" and \"How\" aspects of the qualitative coding are shown to independently capture portions of what we operationalize as construal level, which is shown to relate to downstream affective polarization. In future studies, I will also test additional qualitative coding models, as this model is most applicable to the vague UMass Poll question of issue-oriented responses to critical race theory. In this first model, valence is partially coded for in the \"how\" term, which is why a sentiment analysis has not been performed yet for this Study. In subsequent models in Studies 2 and 3, this will be examined in tandem with an alternative potential coding scheme.\n\n\n## References\nIyengar, S., Lelkes, Y., Levendusky, M., Malhotra, N., & Westwood, S.

To operationalize this for the current task, you will be qualitatively coding along two dimensions – “Who” and “How”. Each of these dimensions will be coded as either a 1 or a 0. This is taken from the Critical Race Theory data, although the measurement does not apply to CRT in particular, it is somewhat unrelated.\n\n“Who” Overview: The purpose of coding this “Who” construct is to understand how clearly people perceive the groups involved in political issues. A “1” for this will involve a specific group mentioned. A specific group involves a group name that cannot be interpreted in multiple ways. This includes any concrete demographic.\n\nWho “1” examples: Mention of… “Democrats”, “Republicans”, “Marxists”, “Kids”, “Blacks”, “Whites”, “Teachers”… any other instances where it is expressly clear that they are referring to a specific group.\n\nIf there is even one occurrence of any of these in the free response, it should be coded as “1.”\n\nWho “0” examples: No groups mentioned, or groups are only mentioned in the abstract. Examples of groups mentioned in the abstract: “People of Color”, “Certain groups of people.”\n\nIf there is no specific group information, or only abstract groups, or they respond “I don’t know”, “Who” should be coded as a “0.”\n\n“How” Overview: The purpose of coding this “How” construct is to understand whether respondents will try to provide information about their own perspectives to the reader, despite this not being the purpose of the task, which was to “Define critical race theory.”\n\nHow “1” coding: If you code a response as a “1” for “How”, it should be from a “yes” answer to one or both of these two questions; 1. Does the respondent mention how they personally feel about the merit of Critical Race Theory? 2. Is the respondent trying to suggest to you how you should feel about the merit of Critical Race Theory? This includes both positive and negative perspectives about Critical Race Theory.\n\nHow “0” Coding: A “How” “0” should be a response that merely attempts to define, and not provide a description of how the respondent feels about critical race theory.\n\n\n\n\n",
