What does the distribution of LungCap look like?  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(lungcap, aes(x=LungCap))+ geom_histogram()\n``\nThis is not normally distributed as there are far more observations of lower lung capacity than higher suggesting the distribution is negatively skewed.\n \n### 1b. Compare the probability distribution of the LungCap with respect to Males and Females? \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: attempt to use zero-length variable name\n```\n:::\n:::\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlungcap %>%\ngroup_by(Gender)%>%\nsummarise(mean(LungCap))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., Gender): object 'lungcap' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe average lung capacity for females is 7.41, lower than the average for males at 8.31. \n\n### 1c. Compare the mean lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers. Does it make sense?  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlungcap %>%\ngroup_by(Smoke)%>%\nsummarise(mean(LungCap))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., Smoke): object 'lungcap' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe mean lung capacity for non-smokers is 7.77, lower than the mean for smokers at 8.65. At first glance, this seems contradictory as one would guess smokers to have a lower lung capacity than non-smokers.The following grid displays non-smokers as having overall higher lung capacity, conflicting with the mean above.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(lungcap, aes(x = LungCap)) +\nfacet_grid(Gender ~ Smoke)+\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(lungcap, aes(x = LungCap)): object 'lungcap' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n### 1d. Examine the relationship between Smoking and Lung Capacity within age groups: “less than or equal to 13”, “14 to 15”, “16 to 17”, and “greater than or equal to 18”.   \n\n\n### 1e. Compare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group.  \nLung capacity for those under age 13 is 6.36 for non-smokers and 7.20 for smokers.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlungcap %>%\n+ filter(Age <= 13)%>%\n+ group_by(Smoke)%>%\n+ summarise(mean(LungCap))\n\nLung capacity for those between the age of 14 to 15\nlungcap%>%\n+ filter(Age=<15 & Age >=14)%>%\n+ group_by(Smoke)%>%\n+ summarise(mean(LungCap))\n\nLung capacity for those between the age of 16 to 17\nlungcap%>%\n+     filter(Age=<17>=16)%>%\n+ group_by(Smoke)%>%\n+ summarise(mean(LungCap))\n\nLung capacity for those 18 and older\nlungcap%>%\n+ filter(Age>=18)%>%\n+ group_by(Smoke)%>%\n+ summarise(mean(LungCap))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: <text>:6:6: unexpected symbol\n5: \n6: Lung capacity\n        ^\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n### Is your answer different from the one in part c?
