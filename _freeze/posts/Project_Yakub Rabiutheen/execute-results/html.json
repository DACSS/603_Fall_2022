This research project looks specifically at  France and Britain which  are grouped together as Colonial Powers to explore the relationship of Colonialism and international trade. This research project will be looking at data from the Correlates Of War Project, which has international trade data from 1870 to 2015. The cut-off year for this research project will be 1960, as  on December 14,1960, the UN declared Colonialism was a human's right's violation and legally declared Colonialism was over(McWhinney,1960).   \n\n\n# Hypopthesis\n\nThis research project will be testing two hypothesis regarding Britain and France.\n\n#Colonial Powers Hypopthesis.\n1. The Years that France and Britain had more Exports is when the rate of colonization increased.\n2. The Years that France and Britain had more Iron Production correlates to the years France and Britain increased levels of colonization.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(readr)\nColonial_Years <- read_excel(\"C:/Users/yakub/Documents/GitHub/603_Fall_2022/posts/_data/Colonial_transformation_data.xls\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: `path` does not exist: 'C:/Users/yakub/Documents/GitHub/603_Fall_2022/posts/_data/Colonial_transformation_data.xls'\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nImports_Exports<-read_csv(\"C:/Users/yakub/Documents/GitHub/603_Fall_2022/posts/_data/Countries_Imports_Exports.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: 'C:/Users/yakub/Documents/GitHub/603_Fall_2022/posts/_data/Countries_Imports_Exports.csv' does not exist.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmilitary_raw_metals<-read_csv(\"C:/Users/yakub/Documents/GitHub/603_Fall_2022/posts/_data/NMC_v4_0.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: 'C:/Users/yakub/Documents/GitHub/603_Fall_2022/posts/_data/NMC_v4_0.csv' does not exist.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n#Descriptive Statistics.\n\n\nAs shown below, I tried finding Data regarding when colonialism began by France and Uk and seeing whether France and UK had more Trade Surpluses as they expanded their colonial empire. However, I was proven wrong as it appears that the UK has been running a Trade Deficit and has never had a Trade Surplus during their Colonial era pre-1960s. As such, I will have to change the approach of this research study. It appears the Balance of Trade has no relationship to Colonialism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolnames(Colonial_Years)[3] <- \"Colonizing Country\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in colnames(Colonial_Years)[3] <- \"Colonizing Country\": object 'Colonial_Years' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolnames(Colonial_Years)[4]<- \"Year_Colonization_Began\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in colnames(Colonial_Years)[4] <- \"Year_Colonization_Began\": object 'Colonial_Years' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nColonial_Years<-select(Colonial_Years,\"Colonizing Country\",\"Year_Colonization_Began\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in select(Colonial_Years, \"Colonizing Country\", \"Year_Colonization_Began\"): object 'Colonial_Years' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nColonial_Years<-filter(Colonial_Years,`Colonizing Country` %in% c(\"F\",\"UK\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in filter(Colonial_Years, `Colonizing Country` %in% c(\"F\", \"UK\")): object 'Colonial_Years' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(Colonial_Years)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in table(Colonial_Years): object 'Colonial_Years' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nImports_Exports%>% filter(year < '1960') \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in filter(., year < \"1960\"): object 'Imports_Exports' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolonial_trade<-filter(Imports_Exports,`stateabb` %in% c(\"FRN\",\"UKG\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in filter(Imports_Exports, stateabb %in% c(\"FRN\", \"UKG\")): object 'Imports_Exports' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(scipen = 999)    \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nCreated a Forumula to calculate Trade Surplus and Deficits.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolonial_trade$trade_balance<-(colonial_trade$exports-colonial_trade$imports)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'colonial_trade' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nFound a better way to find years that France and Britain were running Trade Deficits.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(colonial_trade[colonial_trade$exports < colonial_trade$imports,] )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in print(colonial_trade[colonial_trade$exports < colonial_trade$imports, : object 'colonial_trade' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI did the inverse to find that the UK has always had a Trade Deficit\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(colonial_trade[colonial_trade$exports > colonial_trade$imports,] )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in print(colonial_trade[colonial_trade$exports > colonial_trade$imports, : object 'colonial_trade' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMy finding has found that there is no relationship between Trade Deficits and Colonialism as the UK has never had a positive trade balance.\n\n\n\n\n##Conclusion\n\nI think that the approach of my research has to be changed as my initial theory about trade deficits and Colonialism has been disapprove. As such, I think I will shift this project towards a different approach. I will try exploring the historical prices of commodity goods when France and U.K. were colonial powers.\n\n\n\n\n\n# References\nMcWhinney, E. (1960, December 14).
