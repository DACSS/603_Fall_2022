Smith's score is .006 under the same threshold and therefore still considered statistically significant. \n\n\n# C\n\n\nThis example illustrates the importance of reporting actual p-values as sometimes the margin of difference between p-values can be minor but still have a major impact on whether results are considered statistically significant. This can mislead readers as test results may be improperly discounted, due to the impact of minor differences in data, although results may otherwise be almost identical to a test done using a different comparable but non-identical sample. View the actual p-value allows readers to better understand the data studied by view the degree of difference results show from the confidence level used. \n\n\n\n\n## Q6\n\n\nCreate a data frame with a column for tax values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngas_taxes <-  data.frame (first_column  = c(51.27, 47.43, 38.89, 41.95, 28.61, 41.29, 52.19, 49.48, 35.02, 48.13, 39.28, 54.41, 41.66, 30.28, 18.49, 38.72, 33.41, 45.02)) \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngas_taxes\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   first_column\n1         51.27\n2         47.43\n3         38.89\n4         41.95\n5         28.61\n6         41.29\n7         52.19\n8         49.48\n9         35.02\n10        48.13\n11        39.28\n12        54.41\n13        41.66\n14        30.28\n15        18.49\n16        38.72\n17        33.41\n18        45.02\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames(gas_taxes) <- c(\"tax\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nUsing a one sample t-test where null hypothesis is mean tax is 45 and alternative hypothesis is true mean is less than 45 we are able to reject the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence level.
