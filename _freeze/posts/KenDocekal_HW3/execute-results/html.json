We can see that for most sites precipitation has a somewhat wide distribution confined towards the lower end of the range with some outliners. OPRC precipitation is has greater spread while OPSLAKE and BSAAM show somewhat of a convex relationship.\n\nLooking at the last row comparing runoff (y-axis) to precipitation (x-axis); there is minimal correlation between precipitation from APMAM, APSAB, and APSLAKE and runoff levels but a strong positive linear correlation with precipitation from OPBPC, OPRC, and OPSLAKE sites. OPBPC, OPRC, and OPSLAKE sites' greater correlation with BSAAM implies that these sites may be closer or more influential to stream runoff volume near Bishop CA.\n\nWhen focusing on the relationships between precipitation across sites there seems to be two groupings with high correlations; APMAM, APSAB, and APSLAKE all show fairly strong positive linear relationships with each other as do OPBPC, OPRC, and OPSLAKE. Across these groups of variables however the relationship is less clear and values are generally clustered among the lower values.This implies that sites based on these two groupings may share closer geographic proximity and are therefore more similarly affected by precipitation levels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npairs(water)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](KenDocekal_HW3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Q4\n\nLoading in Rateprof data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata('Rateprof', package = 'alr4')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nSpecifying rating variables - quality, helpfulness, clarity, easiness, raterInterest.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nRateprof1 = subset(Rateprof, select = c(quality, helpfulness, clarity, easiness, raterInterest))\n\nhead(Rateprof1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   quality helpfulness  clarity easiness raterInterest\n1 4.636364    4.636364 4.636364 4.818182      3.545455\n2 4.318182    4.545455 4.090909 4.363636      4.000000\n3 4.790698    4.720930 4.860465 4.604651      3.432432\n4 4.250000    4.458333 4.041667 2.791667      3.181818\n5 4.684211    4.684211 4.684211 4.473684      4.214286\n6 4.233333    4.266667 4.200000 4.533333      3.916667\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot matrix shows very strong positive linear relationships between quality, helpfulness, and clarity.

Increased hours watching TV is correlated with a small decrease in high school GPA. \n\n\n\n\n\n",
