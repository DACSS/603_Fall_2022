Sale price is worth noting with a minimum of $72,000 and a max of $2.6 million. There are some pretty old homes in the data set with the most at almost 100 years old. A minimum age of zero may be something to watch out for because it is not clear as to if the home is less than 1 year old. I must also find out how the distance is measured. I believe distance in this data set is measured in feet so we can see there may be a few water front properties that I will guess fetch a high sale price. Homes farther away may be cheaper if they are not located near another desirable location. \n\nWhile typically a negative, the distance to highway can be viewed as a positive trait to a home. For the sake of this analysis and to go with typical association with close proximity to a highway, I will view closer distance as a negative. \n\nAnother note, is I will have one linear model, m1, to act as the model with all of the variables in it. I want it as a baseline model to see the factor all of the variables play in house price. Since multicollinearity may be a factor, I will not use this model too much. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1 <- lm(sale_price ~ ., data = miami_housing)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in is.data.frame(data): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Hypothesis Testing\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(miami_housing$sale_price)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in t.test(miami_housing$sale_price): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Checking for Multicollinearity\nI want to run a correlation matrix for some of the variables so I can see if there will be issues of multicollinearity. This is checking for multicollinearity for the distance_to variables\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggpairs(miami_housing, columns = 8:13)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggpairs(miami_housing, columns = 8:13): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThankfully, it looks like I only have to keep note of a few variables that look to be highly correlated with one another. Distance to business center and subcenter must be in the same area, or at least close enough because 0.766 seems a bit too correlated. Ocean distance and water distance are worth noting, but not to the same degree as the prior two variables since 0.49 is just below what I would consider significant.  \n\n# Simple Linear Regression\n\nBy running a few linear models, I am getting closer to the conclusion that there is no one inidicator of sale price, but multiple. Multiple linear regression models will have to be run in order to make a sound conclusion as to what is the most significant indicator of price for single family homes. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm2 <- lm(sale_price ~ dist_2_ocean, data = miami_housing)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in is.data.frame(data): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm3 <- lm(sale_price ~ home_age, data = miami_housing)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in is.data.frame(data): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm4 <- lm(sale_price ~ land_sqfoot, data = miami_housing)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in is.data.frame(data): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(lm(sale_price ~ longitude*latitude, data = miami_housing))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in is.data.frame(data): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nAccording to this model with longitude and latitude as interaction terms, they alone are not too significant in the prediction of house prices. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstargazer(m2, m3, m4, type = \"text\", ci.level = 0.9)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in stargazer(m2, m3, m4, type = \"text\", ci.level = 0.9): could not find function \"stargazer\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n# Visualization\nI don't love looking at the notation for sale price, but for now it will do. This visualization of price and distance to ocean is about how I expected it would go. We can see homes closer to the ocean go for the most amount of money, but at the ~40,000 and ~60,000ft distance, there is a spike. This I would like to figure out. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(miami_housing, aes(x = dist_2_ocean, y = sale_price))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(miami_housing, aes(x = dist_2_ocean, y = sale_price)): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI use mapview here just to get a birds-eye view of the entire Miami area. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmapview(miami_housing, xcol= \"longitude\", ycol = \"latitude\", legend = mapviewGetOption(\"sale_price\"),crs = 4269, grid = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(quote(list(...)), env): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Multiple Linear Regression\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm5 <- lm(sale_price ~ land_sqfoot + dist_2_biz_center*dist_2_ocean + dist_2_hiway + structure_quality*home_age, data = miami_housing)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in is.data.frame(data): object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#summary(m5)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis first model I ran is a good start. An adjusted R-squared is quite high when I compare it with the first model. Every variable is considered significant here, even the interaction terms. I chose to have distance to ocean and business center interact because I deemed those two as the most important distance variables and I wanted them both to be taken into account together. Home age and structure quality also interact because typically a home that is older will have a poorer structure. Let me check this to see if they are correlated. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor.test(miami_housing$home_age, miami_housing$structure_quality, method = \"kendall\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in cor.test(miami_housing$home_age, miami_housing$structure_quality, : object 'miami_housing' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThere appears to be no correlation between structure and age, which is interesting because their reaction is significant according to the model.

No data set is perfect so I need to confirm this is fine to keep. The data may be slightly skewed since the data is linear until the 2 mark of Theoretical Quantities. This indicates the model and data set are not normally distributed. \n\nThe fitted values and residuals graph checks for linearity and constant variance assumptions. The constant variance assumption is violated here. \n\nI logged the sale price which seemed to correct the plots tremendously. The QQ and residuals fitted seemed to even out and fall along the lines of a normal distribution. \n\nInitially, before I logged sales_price, the QQ plot was not as linear as I would have hoped. After logging the sales_price variable, it fixed the residuals vs fitted graph as well as the QQ plot. I created another model to compare the logged and unlogged diagnostic graphs. Currently, I do not think I will include this in the final project. \n\n\n\n",
