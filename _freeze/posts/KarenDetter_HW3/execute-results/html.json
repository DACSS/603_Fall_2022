As a result, the prediction equation line becomes less steep, as each value of x is increased for the identical corresponding y-value.\n\n### (b) \nThe currency conversion would not change the correlation, as the *relative* values of the variables remain unchanged.\n\n## Q.3\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##load data\ndata(water)\n##draw scatterplot matrix\npairs(water)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](KarenDetter_HW3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThese scatterplots show that when precipitation at OPBPC, OPRC, and OPSLAKE increases, the runoff volume at BSAAM goes up. Precipitation at the other three locations does not seem to have a strong linear relationship with stream runoff volume.\n\nAlso, precipitation rates at the first three sites seem to be somewhat intercorrelated, as do the rates at the last three sites, indicating that the sites in each set may be closer to each other or share similar geographic features.\n\n## Q.4\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##load data\ndata(\"Rateprof\")\n##draw scatterplot matrix of selected variables\npairs(~Rateprof$quality+Rateprof$helpfulness+Rateprof$clarity+Rateprof$easiness+Rateprof$raterInterest, lwd=2, labels = c(\"QUALITY\", \"HELPFULNESS\", \"CLARITY\", \"EASINESS\", \"Rater INTEREST\"), pch=19, cex = 0.75, col = \"blue\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](KarenDetter_HW3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nSurprisingly, it doesn't seem that reviewers' ratings of their interest in the subject or the easiness of the course correlate with ratings of the professor's quality, helpfulness, or clarity. Ratings for those three traits, however, all seem to have linear relationships with each other.\n\n## Q.5\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##load data\ndata(student.survey)\n```\n:::\n\n### (i)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##convert factor variables to numeric\npi_conv <- as.numeric(student.survey$pi)\nre_conv <- as.numeric(student.survey$re)\n##run regression analysis\nmodel1 <- lm(pi_conv ~ re_conv, data = student.survey)\nsummary(model1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pi_conv ~ re_conv, data = student.survey)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.81243 -0.87160  0.09882  1.12840  3.09882 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

As the level of religiousness increases,  political ideology becomes more conservative, with religiousness explaining 34% of the variance in ideology. Because of the small number of observations (n=60), scatterplot points do not appear tightly aligned to the regression line, but there is a clear upward-moving trend. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = student.survey, aes(x = tv, y = hi)) +\n  geom_jitter(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 3.441353, slope = -0.018305) +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](KarenDetter_HW3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe effect of hours of tv watched on grade point average is not very strong, with the p-value of .0388 being just below the significance threshold. The relationship between the variables is inverse - mean gpa decreases by .02 for every increase in hours of tv watched. Hours of tv watched per week explain 7% of the variance in grade point averages. The scatterplot, again affected by small sample size, does show a slight trend of gpa decreasing as tv level increases.\n",
